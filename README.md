# Cold Compress Encoder

This is just a simple encoding program that was developed through completing a programming challenge from the University of Waterloo's Canadian Computing Competition (CCC).

## How it works

1. The first prompt asks how many inputs are to be encoded

2. The second prompt asks for the messages to be encoded

3. The program will output the encrypted messages

4. Finally, the program will ask the user if they would like to encode another message
